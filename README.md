# ENHANCEMENT OF PRINT MEDIA USING AUGMENTED REALITY 
# krishnakrish24.github.io

This is a final year project done at the Department of Printing Technology, CEG, Chennai.

This project is aimed to add AR as a value addition to
printed products such as business cards that enables user
interactivity without the need of a standalone mobile app.
The web app is coded with HTML5 and JavaScript.

Open up the site "krishnakrish24.github.io" in your browser.
Point your camera towards the AR card
that can be downloaded from this repository and
Also interact with the overlayed 3D objects to
trigger appropriate actions associated.
